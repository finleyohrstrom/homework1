		<p>
			My life is an experience, nothing less then a magical adventure through the most complex fantasy world ever conceived. My controller is the metaphysical and my character is the self. I will remember to live. I will remember that everything i want exists in front of me, my deepest desires can be experienced in the darkest moment, as long as a let them manifest. The spectrum of white to black, light to dark, love to hate, peace to misery, all exist within me in their entirety, that i can not control. The only thing i can control is which piece of all of it i am going to experience. This is my internal quest.
			<br/>
			Outside of myself, many things exist, but in many ways we are one. Peace in the collective reality is the quest of the external and my binary relation to it. To find peace in myself is my greatest responsibility to work towards peace in the collective. As i live my quest to do this i will search to find the balance in giving and receiving, how much benefit is the collective receiving in relation to the relative damage. As i progress in my journey, i develop the responsibility to share with the blind what i have been given the gift to see, and utilized to understand. All the answers to this universe are written on my freckled shoulders, to decipher their beauty and their knowledge is what it is to live.
